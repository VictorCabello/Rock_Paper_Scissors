# rock_paper_scissors

This repo contains a small python application that represents the "Rock Paper Scissors" game and use it to illustrate some basic test automation techniques.

## Unit Test

In my opinion one of the best way to start with automation testing is from the develop stage, as soon as we can provide feedback about a specific feature it would be more easy to solve issues.

Run the flowing command to run the unit tests.

```
$ python setup.py test
```

This project integrates *nose* a very popular unit test framework with setuptools in order to make easy to run the test for the developers.


### nose

### Coverage

In addition when we run the unit test part of this project a coverage report is generated under the coverage folder.


We can define coverage like the number of lines that are cover by the unit test cases and additional information could be found in the next link:
